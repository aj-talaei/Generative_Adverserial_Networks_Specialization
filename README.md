# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization


![](/resources/Certification.png)

This repository contains my projects completed during the [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/generative-adversarial-networks-gans) offered by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful machine learning models capable of generating realistic image, video, and voice outputs. 

Rooted in game theory, GANs have wide-spread application: from improving cybersecurity by fighting against adversarial attacks and anonymizing data to preserve privacy to generating state-of-the-art images, colorizing black and white images, increasing image resolution, creating avatars, turning 2D images to 3D, and more.
